# Namma Yatri Trips Analysis: A Data-Driven Dashboard

This repository serves as a comprehensive resource for understanding, implementing, and leveraging the Namma Yatri data dashboard. The project integrates Power BI for advanced data visualization, SQL for robust data extraction and manipulation, and Excel for streamlined raw data management.

## Project Overview

Namma Yatri is a community-driven initiative committed to delivering a seamless auto and cab booking experience across key Indian cities, including Bengaluru, Delhi, Hyderabad, Chennai, Kochi, Mysore, and Tumkur. This analytical project is specifically designed to meticulously track and visualize critical performance metrics of the service, thereby yielding actionable insights into operational efficiency, user engagement, and overall financial performance.

### Key Components:

1.  **Data Visualization (Power BI)**:
    * **Purpose**: The Power BI dashboard is engineered to provide an immediate, at-a-glance overview of essential metrics. These include the total number of completed trips, user search activities, fare estimates, driver earnings, and critical conversion rates.
    * **Key Visualizations**:
        * **Trips vs. Duration**: Illustrates the direct relationship between the volume of trips and their respective durations.
        * **Fare vs. Duration**: Depicts the correlation between the trip fare amount and the duration of each trip.
        * **Distance vs. Duration**: Showcases the relationship between the distance traveled and the corresponding trip duration.
        * **Trip Fare by Location**: Provides a comparative analysis of total fare earnings across diverse geographical locations.

2.  **Data Extraction and Manipulation (SQL)**:
    * **Purpose**: SQL scripts are strategically employed to efficiently extract, transform, and load raw data into a highly structured format. This structured data is then optimally prepared for consumption by the Power BI dashboard. These scripts are instrumental in processing data from various sources, ensuring data cleanliness, organization, and analytical readiness.

3.  **Raw Data Management (Excel)**:
    * **Purpose**: Excel serves as the primary repository for storing the raw, foundational data. This includes detailed trip records, comprehensive fare information, and location-specific metrics. This data layer is critical for subsequent analysis and visualization processes.
    * **Contents**:
        * Detailed trip records
        * Comprehensive fare breakdowns
        * Search and quote data
        * Location-based performance metrics

## Dashboard Setup and Usage Guide

1.  **Database Setup**:
    * Execute the provided SQL scripts within your preferred database management system. This step will facilitate the creation of necessary tables and the extraction of relevant data, which is paramount for populating the dashboard with accurate and current information.

2.  **Power BI Dashboard Integration**:
    * Open the Power BI project file to engage with the pre-configured dashboard. It is imperative to ensure that all data connections to your database and Excel files are correctly established and configured for seamless operation.
    * The dashboard offers dynamic exploration capabilities through intuitive filters and interactive visuals, enabling stakeholders to conduct deep dives into specific operational facets of the service.

3.  **Data Refresh Protocol**:
    * Regular updates to the underlying Excel data or the re-execution of SQL queries will automatically refresh the Power BI dashboard. This ensures that the dashboard consistently reflects the most current operational information and trends.
